# A fast network tester for android #

  * Is that open wifi really letting you access the web? _Android Network Tester_ **quickly** validates you're connected to the real web (by downloading a dedicated 36 bytes file and checking its content). If the hotspot is actually redirecting you to a billing or authentication portal, you'll know instantly.

  * For troubleshooting any data connection, you can also validate hostname resolution and TCP connection.

  * And for testing the stability of the connection, _Android Network Tester_ lets you measure downlink speed on a 10K, 100K, 1M and 10M HTTP download (ok, that's essentially for statistics and fun sake)
